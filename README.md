# ImpressControl
A key based controller for LibreOffice Impress designed mostly to change slides of a presentation without having the window focused.

In future I may add more features, I didn't put much effort into this as I only needed it for one school thing lol.

## How it works:
It uses a TCP connection to connect to Impress Remote.

See the [protocol documentation](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/tree/sd/README_REMOTE) for details.
